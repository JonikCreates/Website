# Jonathan Koutin — Static Portfolio

This is a minimal static personal portfolio for Jonathan Koutin.

Local preview:
1. Save the files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) into a folder.
2. Start a local server:
   - Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
   - Open: `http://localhost:8000`

Quick customization:
- Update your name, bio, skills and projects directly in index.html.
- Email is set in the quick facts button attribute: `data-email="jonikatwork@outlook.com"`.
- Replace the resume link and social URLs.

Contact forms:
- The form currently uses `mailto:jonikatwork@outlook.com`. To receive submissions via web:
  - Formspree: set `action="https://formspree.io/f/your-id"` and method `POST`
  - Netlify Forms: add `data-netlify="true"` and deploy to Netlify
  - Or use your own server endpoint.

Deploying:
- GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages on the main branch (root).
- Vercel / Netlify: connect repo and deploy — both detect static sites automatically.

What I can do next:
- Add your skills list and 2–6 projects (title, short description, live link and/or repo link).
- Replace social links and add a resume PDF.
- Change the accent color or font.
- Initialize a GitHub repo and deploy to GitHub Pages (I can push if you provide owner/repo and grant access).

Send me: preferred skills, projects, social URLs, resume file (or link), and any color/font preference and I’ll update the site.
